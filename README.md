# Portfolio Example


## Description

This main aim of this project is to create a portfolio example that will be used to showcase work samples. The portfolio can then be made available for a potential employer to be able to view and assess the work present and make a decision as to whether it makes the owner of that portfolio a good candidate for an open position.  

## User Story

```
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```


## Acceptance Criteria

Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring manager’s needs:

```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
```

## Webpage Characteristics

* The webpage was wireframed to understand what the end result should look like - the initial wireframe and updated wireframe will be added in this READ.ME 
* When each of the links in the navigation bar is selected, the user is taken to the section of the webpage that corresponds to that link
* The webpage includes the developer's name, an avatar and links to an 'about me' section, their work and ways to contact them.
* When the 'work' section is selected, the user is taken to the section with the tiled images with an example of a deployed application present.  
* The webpage includes a section that takes the user to a deployed application - this is the 'Refactoring' image which is larger than the other images in that section
* When the page is resized and viewed on various screens and display sizes, the layout of the page is responsive and adapts to that display size
